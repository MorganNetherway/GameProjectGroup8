Minos placed the head in the Labyrinth in the hope that one day the Minotaur or travellers would stumble across it and turn to stone.

Beware traveller, Kronos is the lord of time, and even setting foot in this chamber without paying homage to the Titan would be foolish, as you could be trapped in a time loop within the deadly maze for eternity, not dying and simply being devoured by the Minotaur over and over till the end of time itself""",
