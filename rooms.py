The Minotaur was born from Minos' wife bedding a bull. His appetite grew too fast, and he began to consume humans for sustenance. Locked away in the Labyrinth, the Minotaur still hungers. A cruel plague befell Athens as recompense for the murder of King Minos' son, the only cure being seven Athenian youths and seven Athenian maidens sacrificed, fated to being devoured by the Minotaur. Commit that sordid abominaiton to his final resting place, and put an end to all this.''',

Most considered the fallibility of the Pythia to be fact. How can the sacred be wrong? Perhaps we simply lack the knowledge to fully understand her.",

He stole fire from Zeus after it was wrongfully taken from mankind, and in return was chained to a rock while an eagle came daily to eat his liver. As Prometheus is immortal, this lasted until the hero Heracles came and freed him. How King Minos obtained that rock is certainly a mystery.",
