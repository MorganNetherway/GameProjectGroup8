known as the Minotaur, who resides at the heart of the Labyrinth of King Minos. Any trace of the outside
world disappeared with the heavy bang of the limestone entrance heaving shut. The air is stale and suffocating,
and no sound travels through it. The smell of rotting flesh crawls along the walls and clings to my body.
The last set of sacrifices came here seven years ago, and by now they should be nothing but bone. Never mind.
I came here to end the cycle. I, Theseus the Glorious, who knows no fear. I have truly set out to do the impossible."""

A glimmering blue well. It feels like I'm being toyed with. The silence is oppressing, slowly rising to a climax of nothing.
I worry that I will be drained of strength before I even reach the Minotaur.
I trace the cracks between the stones, and imagine how formidable the beast must be.
It's almost as if I can see it stomping down these halls, it's cruel strength barely contained by the Labyrinth.
Who built this place? Clearly no mortal man. If the Minotaur, who kills men for mere sustenance, cannot escape, then how can I hope to?
But leaving was not what I volunteered for. I gave myself the goal of slaying the beast, and I will carry it out."""

They tell of a hole leading straight to the Underworld, guarded by Cerebrus.
They speak of a room full of previous trespassers, where the mythical Medusa's head stands guard.
They even talk of a place in which time itself falls apart and recombines in strange ways.
If I could pass all of these trials, I would find myself at the treasure chamber, and be rewarded with wealth beyond imagination.
I didn't come for wealth. Every direction I was told to go, I went another. I remember, back at Athens, philosophers would posit endlessly.
If a tree fell in the woods, and no one was around to hear it, did it fall at all? I write these diaries now to define myself.
To make sure that my time here happened. """

Certainly long enough to feel emptiness of my stomach, or the dry, desperate thirst, or the vestiges of sleep.
Yet, I haven't felt any of these. The passageways grow narrower, and the rooms look unfamiliar.
The whispers are no longer whispers and have turned to thumps. I struggle to hear my own thoughts over the tumultuous din.
Suddenly, I'm back at the well, but this time it's a vast sea. The sun beams down from above, but it gives off no warmth.
The winds are still, but carry the smell of rot and viscera. I turn around, and on the floor lies a patch of straw-like fur, stained with drool.
I remember why I'm here now. I'm comforted by the return of the Labyrinth walls, forming a cocoon of rock and stone around me.
Less comforting is the sound of heavy breathing coming from further down the hall. The sound of air leaving its nostrils echoes towards me.
It won't be long now."""

I suppose the architects of this prison still have a need for me."""
