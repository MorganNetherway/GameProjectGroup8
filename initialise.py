print('''RULES:

The objective of the game is to seek out and kill the Minotaur, by any means neccesary.

Throughout the maze you will encounter numerous powerups, keys, riddles, and weapons to
help you do this. There are numerous locked doors and passageways which you need to figure
out how to navigate. The minotaur, however, has special powers which allows him to traverse
the map unhindered.


You can move 1 tile per turn. Rooms may be multiple tiles tall or wide. ''')
